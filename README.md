  <h3 align="left">README</h3>

  <p align="left">To get started, clone this repository and the capstone-server repository</p>
  
  <p align="left">After cloning the server repo, create a .env file where you will add the following variables: DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, SECRET, PORT (use the value 8080), and DB_HOST</p>
  
  <p align="left">Next, run npm i in the CLI of the server AND the client to install all dependencies</p>
  
  <p align="left">Create a medtrack database using MySQL called medtrack and plug in the DB information to your .env variables</p>
  
  <p align="left">After creating a database, run "npx knex migrate:latest" to create the tables. Next, run "npx knex seed:run" to seed the table with placeholder users</p>
  
  <p align="left">Now that everything is seeded and installed, use "npm run dev" on the server side to boot up the development server</p>
  
  <p align="left">On the client side, use "git checkout test" to jump to the branch with local host endpoints</p>
  
  <p align="left">On the frontend (client side), run "npm start" to boot up the local site</p>
  
  <p align="left">Now that both are running you should be good to contribute</p>
